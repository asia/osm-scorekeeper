# OSM ScoreKeeper

Simple scoreboard for an OSM map-athon

* Add multiple users to a team
* Tally all nodes, ways, and relations which were added / modified / deleted by the team since 'startTime'
* Track target tags (building=yes, amenity=hospital)
* Avoid any double-counts
* Visually map any nodes added / modified / deleted by the team

# Todo

* Automatically refreshing user counts
* Saving teams and tallied data to PouchDB or the URL history
* Visually map ways and relations? Or is that too much data?
